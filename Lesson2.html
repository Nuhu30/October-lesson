                            <p> The Mercedes-AMG E63 used to be the ideal German muscle car to sit in the fast lane of an       Autobahn, scaring other cars out of its way as it dispatched hundreds of miles with a plush interior, comfortable seats and a distant rumble from its oversized V8 engine in front of you. <br
                                No one seems to have told AMG’s engineers that though, because as well as those attributes, Merc’s current E63 S is as gifted down a tortuous B-road as it is on a derestricted highway. might well be big and heavy, but it’ll move with the agility of a car 600kg lighter while being genuinely entertaining in the process.p>
